# Steps
Use the ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button **OR** create the services and run locally.

## Deploy to IBM Cloud 
<!--Update the repo and tracking id-->
[![Deploy to IBM Cloud](https://metrics-tracker.mybluemix.net/stats/527357940ca5e1027fbf945add3b15c4/button.svg)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/watson-banking-chatbot.git)

1. Press the above ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button and then click on ``Deploy``.

<!--optional step-->
2. In Toolchains, click on Delivery Pipeline to watch while the app is deployed. Once deployed, the app can be viewed by clicking 'View app'.
![](doc/source/images/toolchain-pipeline.png)

<!--update with service names from manifest.yml-->
3. To see the app and services created and configured for this Code Pattern, use the IBM Cloud dashboard. The app is named `watson-banking-chatbot` with a unique suffix. The following services are created and easily identified by the `wbc-` prefix:
    * wbc-conversation-service
    * wbc-discovery-service
    * wbc-natural-language-understanding-service
    * wbc-tone-analyzer-service

## Run locally
> NOTE: These steps are only needed when running locally instead of using the ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button.

<!-- there are MANY updates necessary here, just screenshots where appropriate -->

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create Watson services with IBM Cloud](#2-create-watson-services-with-ibm-cloud)
3. [Import the Conversation workspace](#3-import-the-conversation-workspace)
4. [Load the Discovery documents](#4-load-the-discovery-documents)
5. [Configure credentials](#5-configure-credentials)
5. [Run the application](#6-run-the-application)

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `watson-banking-chatbot` locally. In a terminal, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/watson-banking-chatbot
```

We’ll be using the file [`data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json`](data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json) and the folder
[`data/conversation/workspaces/`](data/conversation/workspaces/)

### 2. Create Watson services with IBM Cloud

Create the following services:

* [**Watson Conversation**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation)
* [**Watson Discovery**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/discovery)
* [**Watson Tone Analyzer**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/tone-analyzer)
* [**Watson Natural Language Understanding**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding)

### 3. Import the Conversation workspace

Launch the **Watson Conversation** tool. Use the **import** icon button on the right

Find the local version of [`data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json`](data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json) and select
**Import**. Find the **Workspace ID** by clicking on the context menu of the new
workspace and select **View details**. Save this ID for later.

*Optionally*, to view the conversation dialog select the workspace and choose the
**Dialog** tab, here's a snippet of the dialog:

![](doc/source/images/dialog.PNG)

### 4. Load the Discovery documents

Launch the **Watson Discovery** tool. Create a **new data collection**
and give the data collection a unique name.

> Save the **environment_id** and **collection_id** for your `.env` file in the next step.

Under `Add data to this collection` use `Drag and drop your documents here or browse from computer` to seed the content with the five documents in `data/discovery/docs`.

### 5. Configure credentials

The credentials for IBM Cloud services (Conversation, Discovery, Tone Analyzer and
Natural Language Understanding), can be found in the ``Services`` menu in IBM Cloud,
by selecting the ``Service Credentials`` option for each service.

The other settings for Conversation and Discovery were collected during the
earlier setup steps (``DISCOVERY_COLLECTION_ID``, ``DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID`` and
``WORKSPACE_ID``).

Copy the [`env.sample`](env.sample) to `.env`.

```
$ cp env.sample .env
```
Edit the `.env` file with the necessary settings.

#### `env.sample:`

```
# Replace the credentials here with your own.
# Rename this file to .env before starting the app.

# Watson conversation
CONVERSATION_USERNAME=<add_conversation_username>
CONVERSATION_PASSWORD=<add_conversation_password>
WORKSPACE_ID=<add_conversation_workspace>

# Watson Discovery
DISCOVERY_USERNAME=<add_discovery_username>
DISCOVERY_PASSWORD=<add_discovery_password>
DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID=<add_discovery_environment>
DISCOVERY_COLLECTION_ID=<add_discovery_collection>

# Watson Natural Language Understanding
NATURAL_LANGUAGE_UNDERSTANDING_USERNAME=<add_nlu_username>
NATURAL_LANGUAGE_UNDERSTANDING_PASSWORD=<add_nlu_password>

# Watson Tone Analyzer
TONE_ANALYZER_USERNAME=<add_tone_analyzer_username>
TONE_ANALYZER_PASSWORD=<add_tone_analyzer_password>

# Run locally on a non-default port (default is 3000)
# PORT=3000

```

### 6. Run the application
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime or NPM.
1. Start the app by running `npm install`, followed by `npm start`.
1. Use the chatbot at `localhost:3000`.
> Note: server host can be changed as required in server.js and `PORT` can be set in `.env`.

<!--Add a section that explains to the reader what typical output looks like, include screenshots -->

# Sample output

![](doc/source/images/sample_output.png)

<!--Include any troubleshooting tips (driver issues, etc)-->

# Troubleshooting

* Error: Environment {GUID} is still not active, retry once status is active

  > This is common during the first run. The app tries to start before the Discovery
environment is fully created. Allow a minute or two to pass. The environment should
be usable on restart. If you used `Deploy to IBM Cloud` the restart should be automatic.

* Error: Only one free environent is allowed per organization

  > To work with a free trial, a small free Discovery environment is created. If you already have
a Discovery environment, this will fail. If you are not using Discovery, check for an old
service thay you may want to delete. Otherwise use the .env DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID to tell
the app which environment you want it to use. A collection will be created in this environment
using the default configuration.

<!--This can stay as-is if using Deploy to IBM Cloud-->

# Privacy Notice
If using the `Deploy to IBM Cloud` button some metrics are tracked, the following
information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/IBM/cf-deployment-tracker-service) service
on each deployment:

* Node.js package version
* Node.js repository URL
* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Application GUID (`application_id`)
* Application instance index number (`instance_index`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)
* Labels of bound services
* Number of instances for each bound service and associated plan information

This data is collected from the `package.json` file in the sample application and the `VCAP_APPLICATION` and `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variables in IBM Cloud and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Cloud to measure the usefulness of our examples, so that we can continuously improve the content we offer to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

## Disabling Deployment Tracking

To disable tracking, simply remove ``require("cf-deployment-tracker-client").track();`` from the ``app.js`` file in the top level directory.

# Example: Akka Cluster on Kubernetes

This example app provides an actual example of working Akka Cluster, as such this example app complements the Akka Cluster on Kubernetes guide.

To run the example app, please follow these steps.

## Pre-requisite

* A working Kubernetes installation, i.e. an actual Kubernetes cluster or Minikube.
* Ensure the Docker environment variable is configured to point to the registry used by the Kubernetes cluster.

## 1. Build the Docker base image

Build the Docker base image required by the example app:  

```bash
$ cat <<EOF | docker build -t local/openjdk-jre-8-bash:latest -
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
RUN apk --no-cache add --update bash coreutils curl
EOF
```

The example app makes use of `openjdk:8-jre-alpine` as the base image with `bash`, networking utility (i.e. `ping`, `telnet`), and `curl`.


## 2. Build the example app

Ensure you are at the root directory of the example app. Build the example app by running the following command:

```bash
$ sbt docker:publishLocal
```

## 3. Deploy the example app

Deploy the example app by running the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl create -f deploy/kubernetes/resources/myapp
```

## 4. Confirm the example app is working

Check the logs of the pods created by the example app (i.e. `myapp-0`, `myapp-1`, etc.). The `-f` switch follows the logs emitted by the pod.

```bash
$ kubectl logs -f myapp-0
```

Once the app is started within the pod, a log entry similar to the following should be displayed:

```
[INFO] [10/03/2017 03:44:19.758] [myapp-akka.actor.default-dispatcher-17] [akka.cluster.Cluster(akka://myapp)] Cluster Node [akka.tcp://myapp@myapp-0.myapp.default.svc.cluster.local:2551] - Leader is moving node [akka.tcp://myapp@myapp-0.myapp.default.svc.cluster.local:2551] to [Up]
```

The example app exposes the `/members` endpoint which displays the list of members visible for a particular pod. For example, the following displays the list of members visible from `myapp-0` pod:

```
$ kubectl exec -ti myapp-0 -- curl -v myapp-0:9000/members
  *   Trying 172.17.0.5...
  * TCP_NODELAY set
  * Connected to myapp-0 (172.17.0.5) port 9000 (#0)
  > GET /members HTTP/1.1
  > Host: myapp-0:9000
  > User-Agent: curl/7.55.0
  > Accept: */*
  >
  < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  < Server: akka-http/10.0.10
  < Date: Tue, 03 Oct 2017 04:06:32 GMT
  < Content-Type: application/json
  < Content-Length: 147
  <
  {
    "members" : [ {
      "address" : "akka.tcp://myapp@myapp-0.myapp.default.svc.cluster.local:2551",
      "status" : "Up",
      "roles" : [ ]
    } ]
  * Connection #0 to host myapp-0 left intact
```
